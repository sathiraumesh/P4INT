# üõ∞Ô∏è Simple P4 Ping Topology with Controller

This project sets up a simple Mininet topology with two hosts connected through a P4-enabled BMv2 switch. It demonstrates basic IPv4 forwarding via setting up rules using a simple controller.

## üß± Topology

h1 --- s1 --- h2


- `h1` IP: `10.0.0.1`, MAC: `00:00:00:00:00:01`
- `h2` IP: `10.0.0.2`, MAC: `00:00:00:00:00:02`
- `s1`: Single P4 software switch (BMv2)

## üì¶ Contents

| File            | Description                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------- |
| `ping.p4`       | P4 program implementing basic IPv4 forwarding. |
| `topology.py`   | Python script to define Mininet topology.      |
| `Makefile`      | Build and run commands.                        |

## üöÄ Run Instructions

### 1. Compile and Launch the Topology

Run the following command to:
- Compile the P4 program
- Set up the switch
- Create and launch the Mininet topology

```bash
# compile and run the program
make

# connect to the emulated running BMV2 switch
sudo simple_switch_CLI --thrift-port 9090

## Test 
Once inside the mininet cli run the command

`h1 ping h2`

```
